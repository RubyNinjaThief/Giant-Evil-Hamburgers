  <h1>What is the first word people think when they see an image of M&#38;M's?</h1>
  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <h1 style="font-size:50px"><em>How did we collect this data?</em></h1>
  <p>We gathered our data but creating a google survey and asking people to take them. We got the link to to be submitted to schoology, and we got out CS teacher to post it to her other grade class to have them take the survey as well! We all submitted the survey to our Chat Groups on an app called “Discord” and we got a lot of responses from that source as well. We also in person, face-to-face told people to take our survey and get responses from that. We got around 10 responses from face-to-face people taking the survey. We got around 50-60 responses from the schoology page and the other grade class’s schoology page. We got the rest of the responses from the discord chat.</p>
  <h1 style="margin-top:200px;">Conclusion</h1>
  <p>Its seems like there is no definite pattern in terms of what peoples first thought is. That only similarities that they have is that they are all centered around M&#38;M’s, but that isn’t what we are looking for. Almost all of the responses were positive.</p>
